# Disturbance-Edge-Effects


Investigating effects of meadow interior disturbance patches and seagrass loss on sediment characteristics and sulfide concentrations. 


Tasks:
- [x] Find the stats/comparisons I used to produce values for my CERF abstract. (<i>located in the 'prelim_analysis_test' script</i>)
- [ ] CERF abstract discusses differences in TRS between veg/unveg, but we haven't analyzed these samples. Will need to pull in TRS data from 2023 (but won't be able to use for stats, and these weren't collected along a transect)


Questions to investigate: 

- [x] Is porewater S related to distance from the disturbance edge? (For pooled data? For veg. and unveg. separately?)
   - [x] For surface porewater
   - [x] For rhizome porewater
   - <i> No relationship between porewater sulfide and distance from the veg boundary</i>
- [ ] Are any seagrass parameters related to distance from the disturbance edge? 
   - [ ] Belowground biomass
   - [ ] Aboveground biomass
   - [ ] LAI
   - [ ] Shoot density
- [x] Are any sediment parameters related to distance from the edge? 
   - [x] DBD
   - [x] Porosity
   - [x] OM content


- [x] Is there a difference in S concentration between treatments at the 5m sampling points? (used a paired approach to test at the patch level)
   - No

- [x] Is there a relationship between burrow density and distance from the seagrass boundary? 
   - No. But, across all sites, burrow density is higher in bare sediments, and there is a slight peak just outside of the seagrass edge. 
- [x] Is there a relationship between burrow density and porewater sulfide? 
   - at high burrow densities, there is always higher sulfide (but we dont' have lots of data at high burrow density). sulfide is very variable at low burrow densities.
- [ ] Is burrow density related to sediment OM, DBD, or porosity?
